# -AI-Powered-SOR-RFQ-System-for-Scaffolding
I’m looking for a developer to build a system that simplifies the Schedule of Rates (SOR) search and RFQ process for scaffolding contractors. Currently, finding and filtering the right SOR codes from PDF files takes too long, leading to inefficiencies and delays in the RFQ process. We want a system that makes this process faster and more intuitive.

Project Overview

The system should:

1. Categorize SOR codes based on past jobs (e.g., building type, type of work).
2. Enable users to search/filter SOR data easily. Proposed workflow:
    - Step 1: Select your Building (e.g., School of Business).
    - Step 2: Select your Maintenance Category (e.g., fire hazard).
    - Step 3: System displays all related jobs with height/size filters.
3. Use AI/NLP to match job descriptions with SOR codes (e.g., searching "fire hazard" suggests “hole in ceiling code” or “rusty sprinkler code”).
4. Generate RFQs automatically based on the identified codes.
5. Replace the current manual PDF search with a searchable, AI-driven system.

Example SOR for Reference

To give you a better idea, here’s an example of an SOR entry we typically deal with:

Description: Provide, erect and maintain single layer Putlog bintangor scaffolding for the first 100m² including all cuttings, waste, scaffold boards, etc. removing scaffolding after use and clearing debris off site (rate is for per use for the entire duration of the work where specially order and instructed by S.O. ).

Unit: m^2

$: 2.5

We would like a system where searching for something like "10m scaffolding installation at LKS Building" would automatically surface relevant SOR codes.

Tech Stack & Development Approach

I’m open to your recommendations on the best platform/technology to use. I’ve seen solutions in Python, Java, and Google-based coding tools that might work well, but I’d like to leave it to your expertise.

For your project, we need to build a system that simplifies the Schedule of Rates (SOR) search and Request for Quotation (RFQ) process for scaffolding contractors. This involves automating the process of searching and filtering through SOR codes, categorizing them, and using AI/NLP to match job descriptions with relevant codes. Let's break it down and discuss the tech stack and approach for this solution:
System Overview

    Categorization of SOR Codes:
        Categorize based on job types (e.g., building type, type of work).
        Example: For a job description like "fire hazard", the system should identify and display related SOR codes (e.g., "hole in ceiling code" or "rusty sprinkler code").

    AI/NLP Integration:
        Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to match descriptions with relevant SOR codes.

    Search & Filtering Mechanism:
        Users should be able to search by specific parameters such as building type, maintenance category, and work type.
        Additional filters such as height/size should refine the results.

    RFQ Generation:
        Based on selected SOR codes, generate the RFQ (Request for Quotation) automatically.

    Searchable, AI-Driven System:
        The goal is to replace the current manual process of searching through PDFs with a more intuitive and searchable system.

Tech Stack & Recommendations

Given the requirements, we can consider using the following technologies:

    Backend: Python for AI and NLP (using libraries like spaCy or transformers), Flask/Django for API and web server.
    Frontend: PHP (for the web interface), HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI.
    Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL to store SOR data and related metadata.
    NLP and AI: Use spaCy for text processing and a machine learning model to match descriptions to SOR codes.
    Search: Elasticsearch or a similar engine for fast searching and filtering.

Proposed System Design

    Database Schema:
        SOR_Codes Table: Stores all SOR codes with fields like id, description, unit, rate, etc.
        Building Table: Stores building types.
        Maintenance Category Table: Stores maintenance categories like fire hazard, rusty sprinkler, etc.
        RFQ Table: Stores RFQ data linked to relevant SOR codes.

    NLP Model:
        We will use spaCy or transformers (BERT) for text classification and to match job descriptions with relevant SOR codes.

    Web Interface:
        PHP to build the web interface where users can interact with the system, search/filter SOR codes, and generate RFQs.

Python Code: AI/NLP Matching & Backend

This Python code uses spaCy for NLP-based matching and a Flask API for backend integration.

# Required Libraries
import spacy
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json

# Load pre-trained spaCy model for NLP
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Example SOR data (This would typically come from a database)
sor_codes = [
    {"id": 1, "description": "Provide, erect and maintain single layer Putlog bintangor scaffolding", "unit": "m^2", "rate": 2.5},
    {"id": 2, "description": "Install scaffolding for ceiling repair", "unit": "m^2", "rate": 3.0},
    {"id": 3, "description": "Rusty sprinkler repair and scaffolding", "unit": "m^2", "rate": 4.0},
    # Add more SOR entries here
]

# Flask API setup
app = Flask(__name__)

# Function to match job descriptions to SOR codes
def match_sor_codes(query):
    query_doc = nlp(query)
    matched_sor = []
    for sor in sor_codes:
        sor_doc = nlp(sor["description"])
        similarity = query_doc.similarity(sor_doc)  # Measure similarity between query and SOR description
        if similarity > 0.5:  # Threshold for a match, can be tuned
            matched_sor.append(sor)
    return matched_sor

# API route for searching and getting matched SOR codes
@app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
def search_sor():
    query = request.args.get('query', '')
    if not query:
        return jsonify({"error": "No query provided"}), 400
    
    matched_sor = match_sor_codes(query)
    return jsonify(matched_sor)

# Run the Flask app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation:

    Flask API: This backend API accepts a job description query via the /search endpoint.
    NLP Matching: It uses spaCy to compute the similarity between the job description query and the stored SOR descriptions. It returns matching SOR codes with a similarity score above 0.5 (which can be adjusted based on your needs).
    Database: This example uses hardcoded SOR data. In practice, the data would come from a PostgreSQL or MySQL database.

Frontend: PHP Code for User Interface

Below is a simple example of a PHP script that interacts with the Flask API, allowing users to search for SOR codes and filter results.

<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "GET" && isset($_GET['query'])) {
    $query = urlencode($_GET['query']);  // Sanitize user input

    // Call the Flask API
    $url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?query=" . $query;
    $response = file_get_contents($url);
    $results = json_decode($response, true);
}

?>

        <label for="query">Search SOR Codes:</label>
        <input type="text" id="query" name="query" placeholder="Enter job description...">
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>

    <?php if (isset($results)): ?>
        <h2>Matching SOR Codes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <?php foreach ($results as $sor): ?>
                <li>
                    <strong><?php echo $sor['description']; ?></strong> (Rate: $<?php echo $sor['rate']; ?> per <?php echo $sor['unit']; ?>)
                </li>
            <?php endforeach; ?>
        </ul>
    <?php endif; ?>
</body>
</html>

Explanation:

    Form for User Input: The user enters a job description in the input field.
    PHP API Call: The PHP code sends the job description to the Flask API to retrieve matching SOR codes.
    Display Results: The matched SOR codes are displayed with their descriptions and rates.

Next Steps:

    Data Population: You need to populate the database with all SOR entries. This would be a key component to enhance the search process.
    AI/NLP Tuning: Fine-tune the NLP model and similarity threshold to ensure accurate matches. You can explore using BERT for more sophisticated NLP capabilities.
    Front-End Enhancements: Build a more interactive front-end, possibly using JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js or React for real-time results.

This combination of Python (Flask, AI/NLP) and PHP (Frontend) provides a robust system that simplifies the SOR search and RFQ process. It allows for more accurate, faster, and automated results compared to the current manual method of searching PDFs.
